If you want to add a type to the generatable types you must provide the POJO, that class
must extend the Tablable class, which through inheritance will have to implement the
Generatable interface. You need to provide a name inside the resource.properties files
then add a public static final String for that to be called to ResourceNames.DataTypes inside
the ResourceNames file.

After that you must add a public static final int for that type to the GeneratableFactory
class and update the methods to return a Generatable from there. If you do not do these
steps then the application will not work.
